# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Overview 
This analysis applies Supervised Machine Learning models to predict Credit Risk. Since Credit Risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. The analysis employs different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes, which are as follows:

- Oversampling:
  - Naive Random Oversampling algorithm
  - SMOTE algorithm
 
- Undersampling:
  - Cluster Centroids algorithm

- Combination (Over & Under) Sampling:
  - SMOTEENN algorithm

- Ensemble Learners:
  - Balanced Random Forest algorithm
  - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost algorithm
